# Rock paper scissors lizard spock the game

Welcome to [Rock Paper](https://stacd.github.io/rpsls-game/)

<!-->Insert screen shot of page<-->

This site is a functioning game of chance that askes the user to pick from an option of
objects that have different values for whether they win or lose depending on the computers
that is generated at random, as seen in the image below.

It would appeal to any user that likes easy to play chance games and even Star Trek and
Big Bang Theory fans as this extended version of the game found huge popularity after being
referenced by one of the shows main well loved characters.

## Features

### Player choices

At the screen the user is presented with 5 options to choose from. These consist
of a rock, sheet of paper, pair of scissors, a lizard and a picture of the popular
character Spock from Star Trek.

### Game area

When a user has selected their option there is an area that populates the image of their choice
and this is where the computer generate selection is shown against theirs.

### Score areas

Whilst the user is playing the game the score area keeps a running count of the score for both
the user and computer scores so they can see who has the most wins.

### Footer

Within the footer I have inserted the winning and losing possibilities of the game incasee the user
is unfamiliar with the rules of the game.

## Testing

I have used devtools device bar and Am I responsive to see the responsiveness of my page.

I tested the game by sending the link to family members to use on their own devices and opened it up
on my own device on both chrome and Microsoft Edge.

My external link to the rules video on YouTube also works.

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

When first setting up the project the Favicon icon was not working. Upon checking my code I found
it was my path to the favicon image that was incorrect. Once correct the favicon image then displayed.
